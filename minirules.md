This is a minimal framework of rules for experienced players of fantasy roleplaying games.
It assumes you know that "3d6" means to sum three rolls of a six-sided die.
It assumes you know that one player takes the role of impartial Referee, who prepares an adventure in the form of a keyed map full of monsters, strange wonders, and treasures.
It assumes you know that the remaining players each take the role of an inexperienced but ambitious Player Character.

Furthermore, these rules assume players want enough creative room for each campaign to grow through play into something unique from the last campaign.

# Characters #

For each ability, roll 3d6 and record the total:

- Strength
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Charisma

After rolling all six ability scores, the player may swap two of them if desired.

## Ability Score Bonuses ##

Score  | Modifier
:-----:|:-------:
3      |  -3
4--5   |  -2
6--8   |  -1
9--12  |   0
13--15 |  +1
16--17 |  +2
18     |  +3

## Alignment ##

Choose an Alignments: Law, Chaos, or Neutrality.
Law promotes the order of human civilization, while Chaos favors a world beyond human reason.

## Character Advancement ##

Level | Experience Points
:----:|-------------------
1     | 0
2     | 400
3     | 1,200
4     | 3,600
5     | 10,000
6     | 32,000
7     | 64,000
8     | 130,000
9     | 260,000
10    | 389,000
11    | 500,000
12    | 600,000
13    | 700,000
14    | 800,000
15    | 900,000
16    | 1,000,000

From first through ninth level, characters gain an additional hit die each level, plus any constitution modifier.
At level ten and above, characters gain only two additional hit points per level.
All hit dice are d6.
However, fighters roll two six-sided hit dice, and choose the higher roll.

Characters gain at most one level per session.
Reduce the experience award of a character who would gain more levels so that their XP totals just shy of the second level.

## Number of Daily Spells per Spell Level ##

Character Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
:--------------:|---|---|---|---|---|---
1               | 1 |   |   |   |   |

16              | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5

Clerics do not gain additional spells after level 10.

## Clerics ##

Clerics are militant religious zealots or hunters of the undead.

Each day, they pray for particular spells from their spell list.
At any point during play, a cleric may swap out a prepared spell for the Turn Undead spell.

Clerics use any armor, but only blunt weapons.

At ninth level, clerics establish a religious order of their own, attract devotees, and collect tithes.

## Fighters ##

Fighters use any weapons or armor.

At ninth level, fighters may become lords of their own domain, clearing wilderness to build a castle, raising an army, and levying taxes.

## Magic-Users ##

Magic-users wear no armor, and lack expertise in any weapon demanding more skill or strength than a simple dagger.

Each day, magic-users wrestle incantations from the pages of spell books into their brains.
A cast spell escapes the magic-user's mind completely, unable to be cast again without further sleep and study.

## Attack Bonus ##

All characters start at first level with an attack bonus of +1, which they add to all their d20 attack rolls.
Fighters gain an additional +1 per level (e.g. a fourth-level fighter gets +4).
Other classes gain an additional plus one at levels three, six, nine, twelve, and fifteen.
A sixth-level cleric, for example, gets an attack bonus of +3.

Monsters use an attack bonus equal to their hit dice.

## Armor Class, Encumbrance, Wandering Monsters ##

Of any piece of standard gear, armor is the heaviest and most mechanically important.
We simplify encumbrance by making armor the primary factor for encumbrance and movement.

However, if the characters haul something very bulky or heavy, movement drops to the next lower movement tier.
A fighting-man in plate dragging a statue, for example, falls to 3''.

Furthermore, every 250 coins of treasure carried drops the character's movement by one tier.

The referee makes a wandering monster check every real hour of play time.
The odds depend on the movement rate/encumbrance of the party.
The referee may add an additional wandering monster check at 1 or 2 in 6 when the characters do something that might attract monsters, like noisily bash down a door or roast a kobold.

Armor            | AC | Movement Rate | Wandering Monster Odds
----------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|:----------------------:
Naked            | 10 | 18''          | 1 in 6
Shield only      | 11 | 18''          | 1 in 6
Leather armor    | 13 | 12''          | 2 in 6
Leather & shield | 14 | 12''          | 2 in 6
Chain mail       | 15 | 9''           | 3 in 6
Chain & shield   | 16 | 9''           | 3 in 6
Plate mail       | 17 | 6''           | 4 in 6
Plate & shield   | 18 | 6''           | 4 in 6
+Encumbered      |    | 3''           | 5 in 6

In the ascending armor class system (shown above), a higher AC indicates better protection.
The traditional descending AC system has better armor with lower numbers.
Use the table below for reference, or calculate the difference from 19.

Ascending AC   | 10 | 11 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18

## Hirelings and Henchmen ##

Henchmen and hirelings work for the player characters, although they are non-player characters controlled by the referee.

Hirelings are normal humans with a single hit die.
They work for a fixed rate, do not share in treasure, and gain no experience.
They tolerate only limited risks, commensurate with their pay.
Hirelings include guards, link-boys, bearers, sages, smiths, animal trainers, engineers, alchemists, and sailors.

Henchmen have personal loyalty to a player character.
They work for a half-share of found treasure.
Accordingly, they have a characters class, and gain experience.
Henchmen tolerate greater risks than hirelings (but not abuse).
Each henchman has a loyalty score (2d6), modified by the player character's charisma.
Extreme situations or demands may trigger a loyalty check by the referee.
A henchman who fails a loyalty check might not return for the next delve, might run away immediately, or might even turn against the player character --- biding time until the best opportunity for betrayal.

Charisma |  Maximum Henchmen | Loyalty Modifier
:-------:|:-----------------:|:--------------:
3        |  1                | -3
4--5     |  2                | -2

Range: 24'', duration: permanent until dispelled.

#### 5. Magic Jar ####

Magic Jar rehouses the caster's life essence, intelligence, and soul into an object within 30 feet.

Once within the magic ``jar,'' the caster can possess the bodies of other creatures and people within 120 feet of the jar who fail a saving throw.
The caster can return his soul to the magic jar at any time.

If a body he controls is slain, his life essence snaps back to the jar.
If the caster's body is destroyed while his soul is in the magic jar, the soul no longer has a home other than within the magic jar (although the disembodied wizard can still possess other bodies as before).
If the jar itself is destroyed while the Magic-User's soul is within, the soul is lost.

The spell ends when the Magic-User returns from the jar to his own body.

#### 6. Teleport ####

This spell transports the caster or another person to a destination the caster knows.
Success depends on how well the caster knows the targeted location.

Knowledge of the location may be second hand (from a painting or a map), though with only a 25% chance of success.
Failure results in death.

If the caster has seen but not studied the destination, the chance of failure is 20%.
Half of failures place the traveler 1d10 x 10 feet below the intended location, possibly resulting in death from arrival within a solid substance.
The other half of failures place the traveler 1d10 x 10 feet above the targeted location, possibly resulting in a deadly fall.

If the caster is familiar with the location or has studied it carefully, there is a 5% chance of failure, with 1 in 6 failures arriving below and 5 in 6 arriving above the target location.
In either case, the arrival is 1d4 x 10 feet low or high.

## Magic-User Spells Level 6 ##

If the victim fails his saving throw, the caster sets a task for him.
A victim who ignores the task altogether will die.

#### 4. Invisible Stalker ####

This spell summons an Invisible Stalker with 8 HD.

The stalker cannot be banished by Dispel Magic; it must be killed in order to end its mission.

#### 5. Reincarnation ####

The soul inhabits a new body of the same alignment as the deceased.
The Referee chooses the type of body.
Range: touch, duration: instant.

#### 4. Turn Undead ####

Lawful Clerics ``turn'' undead, driving away the foul creatures or even destorying them outright.

When making a turning attempt, roll 2d6 and consult the table below.
A result equal to or greater than the number shown means all undead flee for 3d6 rounds.
``T'' means the undead creature is destroyed. 
``D'' means the undead creature is destroyed. 
`--'' means the undead is too powerful to turn.

Undead CR |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10+

## Cleric Spells Level 5 ##

#### 1. Commune ####

Higher powers grant answers to three questions the caster poses.
Higher powers don't like being constantly interrogated by mere mortals, so the spell should be limited to one casting per week or so.
The Referee may rule that a cleric casts a double strength Commune spell composed of six questions once per year.

#### 2. Dispel Evil\* ####

Dispel Evil works against items, spells, or agents of Evil.
It also functions against evil sendings, possibly including dreams or supernatural hunting-beasts.
Range: 3'', duration: 10 minutes.

#### 3. Insect Plague ####

This spell only works outdoors.
A storm of insects gathers, and goes wherever the caster directs.
The cloud is approximately 8,000 cubic feet (20' x 20' x 20').
Any creature with fewer than 2 HD exposed to the cloud of insects flees in terror (no saving throw).
Range: 48'', duration: 1 day.

#### 4. Raise Dead\* ####

Raise Dead allows the Cleric to raise a corpse from the dead, provided it has not been dead too long.
The normal time limit is 4 days, but for every caster level higher than 8$^{th}$, the time limit extends another 4 days.
Characters with low constitution might not survive the ordeal; and even for those with a strong constitution, a period of two weeks is required before they can function normally.
This spell only functions on races that can be used for Player Characters (i.e., ``human-like'').

## Treasure ##

Calculate treasure values based on monster XP.
The gold piece value of a treasure equals three or four times the XP of the monster to which the treasure belongs.

Treasures include other valuable items besides gold, silver, and copper coins.
By substituting some currency with unique valuable objects (e.g. --- an oil painting of a historical battle, a fine instrument from a famous luthier, a huge but flawed pearl), the referee makes the treasure more interesting for the players.

A map to a hidden treasure is itself a prized item, and carries the promise of further adventure.

A large hoard may contain magic items.
The referee should roll to trade out gold pieces.

- Each 100gp adds 10% chance of a minor magic item.
- Each 1000gp adds 10% chance of a medium magic item.
- Each 5000gp adds 10% chance of a major magic item.
