This book assumes you know that "3d6" means to sum three rolls of a six-sided die.
It assumes you know that one player takes the role of impartial Referee, who prepares an adventure in the form of a keyed map full of monsters, strange wonders, and treasures.
It assumes you know that the remaining players each take the role of an inexperienced but ambitious Player Character.

Despite omissions for brevity, these rules include the tenpole elements that make the game familiar to players, and from which a referee hangs the creative elaborations that make a campaign unique.

# Characters #

Each characters has a basic class: fighter, cleric, magic-user, or rogue.
Most characters are human, but the referee may allow other types, including elves and dwarves.

## Abilities ##

For each ability, roll 3d6 and record the total:

- Strength
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Charisma

After rolling all six ability scores, the player may swap two of them if desired.

### Ability Score Bonuses ###

Score  | Modifier
:-----:|:-------:
3      |  -3
4--5   |  -2
6--8   |  -1
9--12  |   0
13--15 |  +1
16--17 |  +2
18     |  +3

## Clerics ##

Clerics are militant crusaders, jovial friars, or cunning hunters of the undead.

Each day, they pray for particular spells from their spell list.
At any point during play, a cleric may swap out a prepared spell for the Turn Undead spell.

Clerics use any armor, but only blunt weapons.

At ninth level, clerics establish a religious order of their own, attract devotees, and collect tithes.

## Fighters ##

Whether seasoned soldier, retired gladiator, or haughty duelist, a fighter lives by martial prowess.

Fighters use any weapons or armor.

At ninth level, fighters may become lords of their own domain, clearing wilderness to build a castle, raising an army, and levying taxes.

## Magic-Users ##

Necromancers, mad scientists, and devil wranglers harness arcane energies for their own occult purposes.

These magic-users wear no armor, and lack expertise in any weapon demanding more skill or strength than a simple dagger.

Magic-users begin their day by wrestling incantations from the pages of spell books into their brains.
Once cast, a spell escapes the magic-user's mind completely, unusable a second time without further sleep and study.

## Rogues ##

Rogues include altruistic Robin Hoods, dashing cat-burglar jewel rogues, and merciless petty cutthroats.

Rogues know five broad skills, with each skill rated between one and six.
To successfully use a skill, the player must roll that score or lower on a d6.
New rogue characters start with a 1 in all skills, plus two points the player may assign as desired.
Each time the rogue gains a level, the player assigns one additional point to a skill.

A d6 roll equal to or lower than the skill score indicates success.
For skills with a score of six, roll two dice; a failure occurs only when both dice come up sixes.

- Stealth (hide in shadows, move silently)
- Acrobatics (climbing, backflips, tightrope walking)
- Tinkering (open locks, pick pockets, arm or disarm tiny traps or alarms, safecracking)
- Assassination (poisons, backstabbing, nerve strikes)
- Chicanery (disguise, fast-talking, forgery, intimidation, ventriloquism, coin clipping)

When surprising an opponent, a rogue backstabs with a damage roll multiplied by their Assassination score.

## Elves ##

Elves choose each morning whether to act as magic-users or fighters.
When acting as a magic-user, an elf wears no armor.
When acting as a fighter, an elf casts no spells.

Elf characters maintain one experience total for their magic-user levels and another for their fighter levels.

## Dwarves ##

Dwarves can be either fighters or rogues.
Dwarves make saving throws with a +4 bonus due to their natural fortitude and magic resistance.
Dwarves know about stonework, gems, engineering, and metalwork;
the referee would tell the player of a dwarf when a dungeon passage slopes subtly up or down, for example, even if humans or elves would be unaware of it.
Dwarves notice secret doors on 1--2 in 6 simply by passing near them.

After attaining level 6, dwarves suffer a 50% reduction in subsequent earned experience.

## Alignment ##

Choose an Alignment: Law, Chaos, or Neutrality.
Law promotes the order of civilization, while Chaos favors a world beyond mortal reason.
Law and Chaos do not necessarily neatly correspond to Good and Evil.

## Character Advancement and Hit Points ##

By killing monsters and finding treasure, characters gain experience points (XP).
After accumulating enough experience points, a character advances to a higher level, gaining additional hit points and better abilities.

Level | Experience Points
:----:|-------------------
1     | 0
2     | 600
3     | 1,800
4     | 5,400
5     | 16,000
6     | 32,000
7     | 64,000
8     | 128,000
9     | 256,000
10    | 400,000
11    | 500,000
12    | 600,000
13    | 700,000
14    | 800,000
15    | 900,000
16    | 1,000,000

From first through ninth level, characters gain an additional hit die each level, plus any constitution modifier.
At level ten and above, characters gain only two additional hit points per level.
All hit dice are d6.
However, fighters roll two six-sided hit dice, and choose the higher roll.

Characters gain at most one level per session.
Reduce the experience award of a character who would gain more levels so that their XP totals just shy of the second level.

## Number of Daily Spells per Spell Level ##

Clerics and magic-users cast a number of spells per day of various spell levels based on their character level.

Character Level | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6
:--------------:|---|---|---|---|---|---
1               | 1 |   |   |   |   |
2               | 2 |   |   |   |   |
3               | 2 | 1 |   |   |   |
4               | 3 | 2 |   |   |   |
5               | 3 | 2 | 1 |   |   |
6               | 4 | 2 | 2 |   |   |
7               | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |   |
8               | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 |   |
9               | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 |
10              | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 2 |
11              | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1
12              | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1
13              | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 2
14              | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3
15              | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4
16              | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5

Clerics do not gain additional spells after level 10.

## Attack Bonus ##

Player characters start at first level with an attack bonus of +1, which they add to their d20 attack rolls.
Fighters gain an additional +1 per level (e.g. a fourth-level fighter gets +4).
Other classes gain an additional +1 at levels three, six, nine, twelve, and fifteen.
A sixth-level cleric, for example, gets an attack bonus of +3.

Monsters use an attack bonus equal to their hit dice.

## Armor Class, Encumbrance, Wandering Monsters ##

Of all pieces of standard gear, armor is the heaviest and most mechanically important.
This makes armor the primary factor for encumbrance and movement.

However, when a character hauls something very bulky or heavy, movement drops to the next lower movement tier.
A fighter in plate dragging a statue, for example, falls to 3''.

Furthermore, every 250 coins of treasure carried drops the character's movement by one tier.

The referee makes a wandering monster check every real hour of play time.
The odds depend on the movement rate/encumbrance of the party.
The referee may add an additional wandering monster check at 1 or 2 in 6 when the characters do something that might attract monsters, like noisily bash down a door or roast a kobold.

Armor            | AC | Movement Rate | Wandering Monster Odds
----------------:|:--------:|:-------------:|:----------------------:
Naked            | 10 | 18''          | 1 in 6
Shield only      | 11 | 18''          | 1 in 6
Leather armor    | 13 | 12''          | 2 in 6
Leather & shield | 14 | 12''          | 2 in 6
Chain mail       | 15 | 9''           | 3 in 6
Chain & shield   | 16 | 9''           | 3 in 6
Plate mail       | 17 | 6''           | 4 in 6
Plate & shield   | 18 | 6''           | 4 in 6
+Encumbered      |    | 3''           | 5 in 6

In the ascending armor class system (shown above), a higher AC indicates better protection.
The traditional descending AC system has lower numbers for better armor.
Use the table below for reference, or calculate the difference from 19.

Ascending AC   | 10 | 11 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18
---------------|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:---
Descending AC  |  9 |  8 |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  1

## Equipment ##

Each new character starts the game with 3d6 x 10 gold pieces to buy equipment.
One gold piece (gp) is worth 10 silver pieces (sp) or 100 copper pieces (cp).

## Damage ##

A fighter wielding a martial weapon, such as a longsword, does 1d8 damage.
Fighters who forgo a shield in order to wield a two-handed weapons, such as a polearm, deal 1d10 damage.

## Henchmen, Hirelings, and Experts ##

Henchmen and hirelings work for the player characters, although they are non-player characters controlled by the referee.

Hirelings are normal humans with a single hit die and no attack bonus --- regular folks looking to pick up a gold piece or two as a porter or link-boy.
They work for a fixed rate, do not share in treasure, and gain no experience.
Commensurate with their wages, hirelings tolerate only limited risk.
Employers bear the cost of any gear, weapons, and armor.

Like hirelings, experts do a particular short-term job for an agreed fee.
Unlike unskilled or semi-skilled hirelings, experts earn their pay by domain knowledge or craft mastery.
Typical expert wages include: alchemist 250 gp/week, armorer 25 gp/week, animal trainer 125 gp/week, engineer 200 gp/week, mercenary (+1 attack bonus) 7 gp/week, sage 500 gp/week, ship captain 50 gp/week, ship navigaor 35 gp/week, ship crewman 3 gp/week, spy 500 gp/mission.

Henchmen have personal loyalty to a player character.
They work for a half-share of found treasure.
Accordingly, they have a characters class, and gain experience.

Henchmen tolerate greater risks than hirelings (but not abuse).
Each henchman has a loyalty score.
Initially, the loyalty score equals d6+7, plus the player character's charisma modifier.

The henchman's loyalty score modifies morale checks.

The referee may bump up or down a loyalty score from time to time, depending on the player character's long-term treatment of the henchman.

A failed morale check due to an _extreme_ situation or demand triggers an immediate loyalty score adjustment.
A malcontent henchman might not return for the next delve, might run away immediately, or might even scheme against the player character --- biding time until the best/worst opportunity for betrayal.


Player Character Charisma |  Max. Henchmen  | Loyalty Score Modifier
:------------------------:|:---------------:|:-----------------------:
3                         |  1              | -3
4--5                      |  2              | -2
6--8                      |  3              | -1
9--12                     |  4              |  0
13--15                    |  5              | +1
16--17                    |  6              | +2
18                        |  12             | +3

Henchman Loyalty Score | Morale Check Modifier
:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------
3 or less              | Malcontent. Desertion or betrayal inevitable.
4--5                   | -2
6--8                   | -1
9--12                  |  0
13--15                 | +1
16--17                 | +2
18+                    | Always stalwart. Morale never waivers.

## Magic ##

Magic-users and clerics cast a number of spells per day limited by their level.
Magic-users replenish their expended spells after a night's rest through study of their spell books.
Clerics replenish their expended spells each morning by prayer.

### Spell Books ###

New magic-users start the game with a spell book containing Read Magic/Languages, one spell rolled at random, and one spell chosen by the player.
Upon gaining the ability to cast a higher tier of spells, assume the character, by hook or by crook, has acquired a new spell book containing one chosen and one random spell of that level.
Additional spells must be researched by the character, found in dank dungeon vaults, or looted from the corpses of enemy casters.

Woe for the magic-user who loses his spell books!
The cost of recreating a spell book is equal to that of researching its spells, although the time is less and success assured.

### Spell Research ###

Magic-Users conduct research to create original spells.

1. The player writes a spell description.
2. The referee sets the level of the spell.
3. Together, the referee and player negotiate minor changes or clarifications.
4. The player commits the character's time and money.

The minimum uninterrupted research time to create the spell equals the spell's level in weeks.
During this period, the magic-user forgoes adventuring to sequester herself in her laboratory.
For an equal number of game sessions, the player assumes the role of an alternate character or NPC henchman.

The magic-user's chance of success depends upon how well she funds the research.
Costs in lab glass, exotic substances, and consultations with sages can reach staggering totals, especially for high-level spells.
For each 10% cumulative chance of success, the cost for first-level spells is 1,000 gp, second-level 2,000 gp, third 4,000 gp, fourth 8,000 gp, fifth 16,000 gp, and sixth-level spells cost 32,000 gp.

After the minimum number of weeks, the player rolls percentile dice to check the success or failure of the research.
Success means the magic-user adds the spell to her spell books, and can share it (or not!) with other mages.
Failure means the research drags on for at least one more week, at the end of which the player makes another roll.
After a failure, the magic-user may increase funding to improve chances of success on the next check.

### Scribing Scrolls ###

The few days between delves into the dungeon allow a magic-user enough leisure to scribe one scroll.
The cost of fast inks, scare quills, and blotting sand from distant shores depends upon the spell's level.
A scroll with one first-level spell costs 100 gp.
The cost doubles for each spell level, so scribing a sixth-level spell costs 3,200 gp.

### Brewing Potions ###

While only casters invoke spell scrolls, drinking a potion affects anyone.
Clerics brew up to one potion per week to duplicate the effect of any spell they can cast that affects the caster.
Magic-users brew potions with the help of an alchemist.
Material costs of potions follow that of scrolls.

## Magic-User Spells ##

Polymorph Other turns another being within 60 feet into a different type of creature (such as a dragon, a garden slug, or a newt).
The polymorphed creature gains all the abilities of the new form, but keeps its own mind and hit points.
This transformation lasts until dispelled.

Polymorph Self gives the magic-user the form and attributes (use of wings, for example) of any object or creature, but not its hit points or combat abilities.
This lasts for one hour plus one additional hour for each caster level.

#### 7. Wall of Fire or Wall of Ice ####

The caster announces which form she chooses when casting.

Wall of Fire ignites a wall that keeps burning while the caster concentrates on it.
Creatures with three or fewer hit dice cannot pass through the wall, and no creature sees through it.

### Magic-User Spells Level 5 ###

#### 2. Conjure Elemental ####

The magic-user summons a 16 HD elemental, and binds it to his command.
Each type of elemental may only be summoned once per day.
The elemental obeys only while the caster concentrates;
even momentary loss of concentration unleashes the elemental on a murderous rampage.
Range: 24'', duration: until dispelled.

#### 3. Contact Higher Plane ####

The caster psychically petitions planes, powers, and geometries of the beyond to ask affirmative or negative questions.
The spell's effectiveness and peril depends on how distantly the caster chooses to project her mind.

Plane | Insanity | Right  | Wrong
:----:|:--------:|:------:|:------:
1     | 1--2     | 3--11  | 12--20
2     | 1--4     | 4--13  | 14--20

4     | 1--8     | 9--17  | 18--20

6     | 1--12    | 13--19 | 20

#### 4. Feeblemind ####

Save with a -4 penalty.
Range: 24'', duration: permanent until dispelled.

#### 5. Magic Jar ####

Magic Jar rehouses the caster's life essence, intelligence, and soul into an object within 30 feet.

From within the jar, the magic-user can grasp out to possess the body of any creature within 120 feet that fails its saving throw.
The caster's soul retreats to the jar whenever it desires or if the possessed body dies.

While inside the magic jar, the caster can survive destruction of his original body, but destruction of the jar dooms the soul to oblivion.

The spell ends when the magic-user returns from the jar to his own body.

#### 6. Teleport ####

This spell whisks the caster or another person to a distant place.
Success depends on how well the magic-user knows the destination.

Second-hand knowledge of the location, like from a painting or map, gives a 25% chance of success.
Failure results in death.

If the caster has glimpsed but not studied the destination, the chance of failure is 20%.
Half of failures place the traveler 1d10 x 10 feet below the intended location, possibly resulting in death from arrival within a solid substance.
The other half of failures place the traveler 1d10 x 10 feet above the targeted location, possibly resulting in a deadly fall.

If the caster is familiar with the place or has studied it carefully, the chance of failure falls to 5%, with 1 in 6 failures arriving below and the rest arriving above the target location.
In either case, the arrival is 1d4 x 10 feet low or high.

### Magic-User Spells Level 6 ###

#### 1. Control Weather ####

The caster calls down rain or drains it away, parches the ground or freezes the air, calms the waves or swirls up a cyclone.

#### 2. Disintegrate ####

The caster atomizes one specific target --- a door, a peasant, a statue --- into a scant shower of dust.

Dispel Magic does not banish the stalker; kill it to end its mission.

#### 5. Reincarnation ####

Reincarnation snatches a soul from death, and wraps it in a living body.
The type of body exceeds the caster's control (referee's choice!), but its alignment matches the soul's.

#### 4. Turn Undead ####

Lawful Clerics "turn" undead, driving away the abominations or destroying them outright.

When attempting to turn the undead, roll 2d6 and consult the table below.
A result equal to or greater than the number shown means all undead flee for 3d6 rounds.

Undead CR |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |  9  | 10+

10+       |  -- | --  | --  | --  | --  | --  | 12  | 11  | 9   | 7

This spell only works outdoors.
Range: 48'', duration: 1 day.

#### 4. Raise Dead\* ####

Provided it has not lain dead too long, Raise Dead allows the cleric to breath life back into a corpse.
The base time limit is four days, but for every caster level higher than 8$^{th}$, the time limit extends another four days.
Characters of frail constitution might not survive the ordeal;
even the robust require two weeks of recuperation before they fully shrug off the chill of the grave.
Raise Dead only succeeds for human-like beings.

# Play #

## Exploration ##

"Exploration turns" last ten times longer than combat turns.
Each character takes a single complex action or two simple actions during a turn --- two moves, a move and listening at a door, rigging a pulley, etc.

During exploration, in addition to adjudicating basic actions, the referee considers how far the characters see given the lighting and environment, how long light sources burn before exhausting their fuel, and what sounds echo to or from nearby monsters.

Light Source     | Distance   | Duration
-----------------|------------|----------
Candle           | 10' radius | 1 hour
Torch            | 40' radius | 1 hour
Lantern          | 30' radius | 12 hours
Bullseye Lantern | 80' cone   | 12 hours

## Encounters ##

1. Surprise? Base chance of 1--2 in 6. Check both sides, if appropriate.
2. Set encounter distance based on surprise (if not dictated by environment):
	- If surprised: d4 x 10' (within melee distance)
	- Not surprised: (d6 + 4) x 10'
3. Each side that is not surprised has the options:
	- Evasion (the referee asks: "Do you run away?")
	- Fire missiles
	- Close to melee
	- Parley
	- Other
4. Players declare actions
5. Check monster (re)action
6. Roll initiative (d6 per side)
7. Repeat each turn as appropriate:
	1. Check morale of non-player characters, hirelings, monsters
	2. Missile fire
	3. Melee

To score a successful hit during missile fire or melee, the sum of the attacker's d20 to-hit roll, base attack bonus, and any situational bonuses must equal or exceed the target's armor class.
The attacker rolls damage after a hit, and deducts the damage rolled from the target's hit points.
Any character or monster reduced to zero or fewer hit points dies.

## Evasion and Pursuit ##

A group of player characters or monsters, having stumbled into a disadvantageous situation, may try to evade the encounter, so long as the other side hasn't taken them by surprise.
If monsters take flight, the players decide whether to pursue.
When player characters flee monsters, the referee consults the Monster (Re)actions table;
the monsters give chase on a "hostile" result.

The faster side wins a chase.
If the pursuers have the higher movement rate, they catch the pursued.
Those fleeing make good their escape if they have a greater movement rate than their pursuers.

The frenzy of the chase makes drafting or consulting maps impossible.
When player characters make a getaway through unfamiliar territory, they wind up in a room (selected by the referee) 1--3 full moves from where the chase began, and must reorient themselves.

Players desperate for their characters to escape a faster foe have one final option: a sacrifice.
A player character with the slowest movement, perhaps through heroic self-sacrifice or perhaps after being tripped by another party member, stays behind so that the others escape.
The referee decides whether the sacrificed characters is captured (and eligible for later rescue) or eaten whole.
The remaining player characters find themselves disoriented (as above) and split into 2--3 separate rooms.
They must reorient themselves and reunite.

## Monster (Re)actions ##

Monster reactions may be modified by the situation, rumors about the player characters, bribes, player character charisma, allegiances or antipathies with other dungeon factions, etc.

2d6    | Monster (Re)action
:-----:|------------------------------
2--6   | Hostile --- immediate attack!
7--9   | Uncertain, wait and see, possibly receptive to bribes
10--12 | Positive, possibly even helpful

## Saving Throws ##

Some effects, like the petrifaction caused by a medusa, call for a saving throw.
A successful save avoids or reduces harm (e.g. "save for half damage").
To make a save, the target must equal or exceed its saving throw score with a d20 roll.

The saving throw score depends on the character's level.
For saving throws by monsters, treat the monster as if it has levels equal to its hit dice.

Level/HD | Saving Throw
:-------:|:------------:
1--3     | 14
4--7     | 12
8--11    | 9
12+      | 6

Rather than having a single saving throw score, some referees prefer several types of saving throws.
Saving throw types, if used, reflect the sort of dangers characters encounter.
These might be general fantasy types (e.g. Death/Poison, Petrifaction/Paralysis, Wands, Dragon's Breath, Spells) or dangers specific to the campaign world (e.g. Science Rays, Ectoplasm/Toxic Goo, Cosmic Madness, Voodoo Curses, Hallucinogens, Meteors).
Furthermore, some character classes may excel at particular types of saves (e.g. fighters get +2 to save versus action hero situations).

## Morale ##

Player characters only run when the players decide they run.
However, the sensitive nerves of henchman and hirelings, as well as monsters and non-player characters, sometimes fail in the face of adversity.

The referee decides when to check morale.
A morale check might happen after the first wound, or after the first death, or when only a minority remain standing.
Any round where one side clearly comes off worse than the other threatens morale.

The referee rolls 2d6 to test morale.
A result of 6+ means they stay in the fight, though the referee might bump this target up or down a point or two based on circumstances.
Remember to add the loyalty modifier when checking morale for henchmen.

## Grappling and Subdual ##

One side can attempt to grapple and subdue the opposing side, rendering them incapacitated but otherwise unharmed.
In a grapple, each side rolls all its hit dice and sums the results.
The side with the highest total wins.

For example, four 1 HD dwarves try to grapple a 6 HD cave ape.
The dwarves roll 4d6 for a total of eleven.
The ape rolls 6d6 for a total of seventeen.
So, the dwarves pile onto the simian, but it sends them flying.

# Referee #

## Monsters ##

Suitable monsters include creatures from mythology, giant or mutant animals, the undead, fairytale beings, antagonistic humans, carnivorous plants, fungi, dinosaurs, and even sci-fi elements, like robots or Frankenstein's monster.
Referees expand the roster of monsters by enhancing existing ones (fire-breathing goblins, a basilisk with x-ray vision), varying themes (wereshark, glass shard golem), or devising new monsters from scratch.

### Monster and Encounter Design ###

This points-based system helps build encounters or design new monsters.
It classifies encounters as roughly easy, hard, or deadly for a particular party.
The point system can also assign treasure values for encounters.

Calculate the Challenge Rating (CR) of the player character party by summing points for the following:

- 1 point per hit die
- 2 points per character with plate mail (or better)
- 1 pt per spell caster maximum spell level (e.g. a magic-user who can cast third-level spells is 3 points)

For example, a party with four third-level characters (a fighter in plate for 5 points, a magic-user for 5 points, a rogue for 3 points, and a cleric in plate for 7 points) is worth 20 points total.

This also works for a non-player character party.

Use the challenge rating of the party to set a point budget for creating monster encounters.

Percent of PC Points | Rough Difficulty of Encounter
:-------------------:|-------------------------------------
10--30%              | Easy: routine resource depletion
40--60%              | Hard: a casualty is possible
80%+                 | Deadly: good chance of one or more casualties

Calculate the challenge rating of a monster encounter by summing the following points:

- 1 point per hit die
- 0.5 points per additional monster, rounded down (e.g. four monsters adds 1 points, rounded down from 1.5)
- 1 point per additional attack per round (e.g. claw/claw/bite adds 2 points)
- 2 points for being hard to hit (flying, invisible, strong AC, immunity to non-magic weapons)
- 2 points for attacks that bypass the front line (missile fire, area effects)
- 4 points for a very bad attack or permanent wreckage (save or die, turn to stone, level drain)
- Other special abilities at 0--4 points each

Encounter examples:

- Basilisk (6 HD: 6 pt, stone: 4 pt) = 10 CR
- Adult Red Dragon (9 HD: 9 pt, fly and strong AC: 2 pt, breath: 2 pt, claw/claw/bite: 2 pt) = 15 CR
- One Ogre and four Orcs (8 HD: 8 pt, four extra monsters: 2 pt) = 10 CR


CR   | XP    | Treasure Value (GP)
:---:|-------|--------------------
<1   | 5     | 20
1    | 15    | 60
2    | 30    | 120
3    | 60    | 240
4    | 120   | 480
5    | 240   | 960
6    | 400   | 1,600
7    | 600   | 2,400
8    | 800   | 3,200
9    | 1,100 | 4,400
10   | 1,400 | 5,600
11   | 1,700 | 6,800
12   | 2,000 | 8,000
13   | 2,300 | 9,200
14   | 2,600 | 10,400
15   | 2,900 | 11,600
16   | 3,100 | 12,400
17   | 3,400 | 13,600
18   | 3,700 | 14,800
19   | 4,000 | 16,000
20   | 4,300 | 17,200
21   | 4,600 | 18,400
22   | 4,900 | 19,600
23   | 5,200 | 20,800
24   | 5,500 | 22,000
25   | 5,800 | 23,200
26   | 6,100 | 24,400

To vary the difficulty of encounters in the rooms of a large dungeon area, roll a point budget multiplier for each room with a monster.

d8   | Point Multiplier
-----|----------------
1    | x 0.2
2    | x 0.3
3--5 | x 0.4
6    | x 0.6
7    | x 1
8    | x 3

### Animals and Giant Animals ###

Although normal animals rarely attack humans without provocation, mutations that cause animal gigantism often correspond with behavioral changes, like increased aggression.

HD     | Animals
-------|---------
<1     | Goat, sheep, cobra, frog
1      | Human, dog
2      | Mule, wolf, python
3      | Cougar, draft horse, crocodile, gorilla
4--5   | Tiger, bear, bison
5--6   | Rhinoceros, hippopotamus
7--10  | Orca, elephant
15     | Mammoth
20     | Tyrannosaurus rex

Give a giant snail the size of a mule two hit dice.
Give one the size of an elephant eight hit dice.

## Treasure ##

Calculate treasure values based on monster CR or XP.
The gold piece value of a treasure equals three or four times the XP of the monster to which the treasure belongs.

Treasures include other valuable items besides gold, silver, and copper coins.
By substituting some currency with unique valuable objects (e.g. --- an oil painting of a historical battle, a fine instrument from a famous luthier, a huge but flawed pearl), the referee makes the treasure more interesting for the players.

A map to a hidden treasure is itself a prized item, and carries the promise of further adventure.
The map may show the distant location of a famous item or a simple cache of coins hidden behind a secret door in the next room.
Some obscure their meaning with riddles or codes.

A large hoard may contain magic items.
The referee should roll to trade out gold pieces.

- Each 100 gp adds 10% chance of a minor magic item.
- Each 1000 gp adds 10% chance of a medium magic item.
- Each 5000 gp adds 10% chance of a major magic item.

## Adventure Design ##

### General Scenarios ###

1. Map the unknown
2. Scout enemy outpost
3. Pacify area for future development
4. Destroy enemy threat
5. Visit lost shrine (recover relic, remove curse, etc.)
6. Complete quest
7. Escape enemies
8. Rescue prisoners
9. Cross/close/open magic portal
10. Locate the lost (lost expedition, lost ancient race, etc.)

### General Settings ###

1. Crypt, tomb, or necropolis
2. Temple or shrine (possibly ancient or lost)
3. City, town, or outpost
4. Castle, keep, or tower
5. Caves, cavern, sinkhole, ravine
6. Mine, sewers, cthonic settlement

### Random Dungeon Room Stocking ###

After thoughtfully placing unique monsters and treasures, the referee may stock the remainder of a large dungeon area with the following table.

d12   | Room Contents
:----:|--------------
1--3  | Empty
4     | Trick/trap (no treasure)
5--7  | Monster (no treasure)
8--10 | Treasure & Monster
11    | Treasure & trick/trap
12    | Treasure (concealed/hidden)

### Traps and Tricks ###

Make deadly traps obvious.
What the trap does and its trigger beg investigation, but telegraph its presence to the players.
Foreshadow a room that fills with poison gas, for example, with an acrid smell and faint hissing noise;
players who fail to cautiously pursue those hints (or retreat from the room) can't complain about a save-or-die roll after they turn the dogging wheel on the opposite door, only to find both doors sealed and green steam gushing from nozzles in the ceiling.

Make gotcha traps --- poison needles in door knobs or faux floors that drop characters into pits without warning --- inflict only minor damage or temporary penalties, like 1--3 HP damage or double-vision for a day (-1 to hit).

Tricks differ from traps in that they befuddle players rather than harming characters.
Tricks might be as simple as a false door, or as sophisticated as an imperceptively revolving room that opens onto different hallways depending on its orientation.
Tricks include puzzles, riddles, and nonsense, like a sliding tile game built into a dungeon floor that must be arranged to show a picture of an open door, or a verse inscribed on a wall that must be completed by following the rhyme scheme.

### Adventure Checklist ###

When planning a session, especially a short adventure or lair-type dungeon, consider including the following elements:

- Weird/unique/gross monsters (about three new types)
- A small, non-linear dungeon map (about 8-12 rooms)
- A trap or two
- One or more toys that are not clearly beneficial or harmful, but could be either or just strange
- A secret that might or might not be discovered (secret door, hidden treasure, etc.)
- One or two hooks or hints for further adventures
- Reason to use a funny voice, role-playing opportunity (non-hostile NPC, talking mirror, etc.)
- Something bound to the location that might motivate the characters to return in the future

### Setting up a Megadungeon ###

The type of "lair" dungeons seen in adventure modules is composed of one or two dozen rooms spread over one to three vertical levels, and occupied by a handful of different monster types.
A megadungeon, on the other hand, descends at least ten levels deep --- each level more perilous than the one above it --- with dozens or hundreds of rooms per level occupied by numerous monster factions.
Such a dungeon acts as the tentpole of a whole campaign, with players characters returning to the dungeon's depths week after week between rests at a nearby settlement.

- To start, map and key all or most of the first two or three levels.
- Make the maps non-linear, so the players tackle or bypass areas by choice.
- Let players gauge their risk by depth --- dungeon level three generally gives adequate challenges and rewards for a third-level party, for example (though some individual encounters should be exceptionally easy or deadly for their level).
- Remember vertical movement!
	- Connect each level to several others, not just the levels immediately above and below.
	- Use sinkholes, slides, ladders, elevators, wells, waterfalls, and chimneys, not only boring stairs!
- Populate each level with multiple cooperative or antagonistic monster factions.
- Divide each level into sub-areas with distinct features, under the control of a particular monster faction.
- Even for levels you haven't finished mapping, make a list of important items found there, like:
	- Most of the first level spells can be found on levels one and two, on dusty scrolls or in the hands of enemy spellcasters.
	- Each level holds one or two magic swords, locked in forgotten vaults or possessed by the local anti-paladin.
	- Each level holds one or two major magic items of note.
	- Each level has one or two exceptionally interesting baddies.
- Make a list of rumors about the above, and slowly feed them to the players.
- Write a wandering monster table for each level, and include lost, visiting, or raiding monsters from the adjacent levels.
- Include enough treasure on each dungeon level to give a party of that character level at least twice the XP they'd need to advance (the party won't find all the treasure, and some will be lost to fatalities).
- Add several outside entrances to the dungeon going to different levels.
- Include traces of the dungeon's history: graffiti from previous adventuring parties, relics from long-extinct monsters, or changes to the dungeon geography (flooded areas, cave-ins, bricked-up passages, fresh excavation, etc.).
- Include environmental hazards, like acid pools, low-lying areas where flammable gas pools, radiation, and rock slides.
- Make the dungeon is a living thing --- repopluate cleared areas with new factions, include signs that rival adventuring parties have been setting off traps or making deals with monsters, etc.
